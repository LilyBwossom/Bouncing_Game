# Bouncing game
## Lore
This is a game that I made as an assignment to apply for a game development study. The name of the game is bouncing game, however there unfortunately is no bouncing in this game ðŸ˜”.
I started working on the game when the theme of the assignment was "bounce" (they change this every year), but finished it the year after when the theme was "collide", which the game adheres to more.

## What is the game about?
The game is a very simple 2d platformer written in c++, the instructions on how to play can be found [here](https://github.com/LilyBwossom/Bouncing_Game/blob/main/_game%20readme.txt)

## Compiling
When compiling the game I would recommend setting the V2 flag to true, as this fixes some major bugs that occured in the version that I originally submitted.
